SNHU CS-305: Software Security

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that puts together financial plans to help their clients store their money wisely. They required the security of their customer's data and their data base. For example, the program could hold customer information such as names, addresses, social security numbers, phone numbers, bank information, and more. The program could also do transfers, withdrawls, and deposits. While this data is being transfered, encryption is a must to keep that information secure while in transit.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

I believe that I thoroughly reviewed what they were asking for from their program and what type of security they would need as a financial company. Especially, when it comes to a financial instatute, secure code protects a lot of sensitive information that should not be easily accessed by malicious users. If there was no security, then that could lead to hundreds of thousands of dollars lost for the company and their customers. Which could result in Artemis Finanial becoming bankrupt, being sued and/or closing. 

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

I found that the knowledge I gained from researching how to mitigate the vulnerabilities to be very helpful. It was interesting to look into what versions are safe to use while developing a program. Though, some versions have fixed bugs, but have their own vulnerabilities. So, finding exactly what version is safest to use can be challenging.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
